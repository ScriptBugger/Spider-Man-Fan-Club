      <hr>
      <p>Spider-Man has had lots of films and many more TV shows. Lots of people find him as our favourite hero in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), and sometimes he goes underappreciated. We want our hero to get the fame he deserves (and to get JJJ to finally shut up), and to do this, we have built a fan club. So, welcome, to the Spider-Man Fan Club!</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>On our discord server (by the way you should totally join), we just chill and talk about the Spider-Man himself. We talk about memes, future movies, what we think should happen and just have lots of fun together. Things like this is what we do on our discord. Doing these things are fun, and the server is still under development so that everyone can get the best experience.</p>

      <h2>Our Spider Family</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>We are trying our best to build our spider family, and if you are someone who is interested in the man of spiders himself, then joining our discord would symbolize that you are in the family. When you join the family, we welcome you and we have lots of fun. Some people may be thinking that "Well, what if someone is mean or disrespectful?" Well, our answer to that is that, the more people that join, the more people can become moderators. The more moderators we have, the less bullying will happen as they will be punished on the server (mute, kick or if things go too far, then a ban).</p>
